# enroll_rs_q2
Rust Version of Enrollment 


In this lesson, we are going to: 
1. Learn how to use `solana-sdk` to create a new keypair
2. Use our Public Key to airdrop ourselves some Solana devnet tokens
3. Make Solana transfers on devnet
4. Empty your devnet wallet into your WBA wallet
5. Use our WBA Private Key to enroll in the WBA enrollment dApp

Prerequisites:
1. Have Rust and Cargo installed
2. Have a fresh folder created to follow this tutorial and all future tutorials

Let's get into it!

## 1. Create a new Keypair

To get started, we're going to create a keygen script and an airdrop script for our account.

#### 1.1 Setting up
Start by opening up your Terminal. We're going to use `Cargo` to initialise a new Rust library.

```sh
cargo init --lib
```

Now that we have our new project initialised, we're going to go ahead and add the `solana-sdk` to `Cargo.toml`.

```toml
[dependencies]
solana-sdk = "1.15.2"
```

Finally, we're going to create some functions in our `src/lib.rs` file to let us run the three scripts we're going to build today, and annotate them with `#[test]` so we can easily call them:

```rs
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use solana_sdk;

    #[test]
    fn keygen() {}
    #[test]
    fn airdop() {}
    #[test]
    fn transfer_sol() {}
}
```

Alright, we're ready to start getting into the code!

#### 1.2 Generating a Keypair
We're going to create the `keygen` function to generate ourselves a new keypair.

We'll start by importing `Keypair`, `Signer` and `Pubkey` from `solana_sdk`

```rs
use solana_sdk::{signature::{Keypair, Signer}, pubkey::Pubkey};
```

Now we're going to create a new Keypair, like so:

```rs
// Create a new keypair
let kp = Keypair::new();
```

Now we're going to print out our new keypair to the console!

```rs
#[test]
fn keygen() {
    // Create a new keypair
    let kp = Keypair::new();
    println!("You've generated a new Solana wallet: {}", kp.pubkey().to_string());
    println!("");
    println!("To save your wallet, copy and paste the following into a JSON file:");
    println!("{:?}", kp.to_bytes());
}
```

Now we can click "Run test" on our `keygen` function, or execute `cargo test keygen` in our Terminal to generate a new keypair!

```
You've generated a new Solana wallet: 2sNvwMf15WPp94kywgvfn3KBNPNZhr5mWrDHmgjkjMhN

To save your wallet, copy and paste your private key into a JSON file:
[34,46,55,124,141,190,24,204,134,91,70,184,161,181,44,122,15,172,63,62,153,150,99,255,202,89,105,77,41,89,253,130,27,195,134,14,66,75,242,7,132,234,160,203,109,195,116,251,144,44,28,56,231,114,50,131,185,168,138,61,35,98,78,53]
```

If we want to save this wallet locally, we're going to have to save it to a JSON file. To do this, we'll execute the following command:

```sh
touch dev-wallet.json
```

This creates the file `dev-wallet.json` in our root directory. Now we just need to paste the private key from above into this file, like so:

```json
[34,46,55,124,141,190,24,204,134,91,70,184,161,181,44,122,15,172,63,62,153,150,99,255,202,89,105,77,41,89,253,130,27,195,134,14,66,75,242,7,132,234,160,203,109,195,116,251,144,44,28,56,231,114,50,131,185,168,138,61,35,98,78,53]
```

Congrats, you've created a new Keypair and saved it your wallet. Let's go claim some tokens!

## 2. Claim Token Airdrop
Now that we have our wallet created, we're going to import it into another script.

Start by adding `solana_client` to our Cargo.toml. 

```toml
solana-client = "1.15.2"
```

We're going to need this to import `RpcClient` to let us establish a connection to the Solana devnet, and `read_keypair_file` which lets us import our wallet from a wallet file. Our imports will now be as follows:

```rs
use solana_client::rpc_client::RpcClient;
use solana_sdk::{
        signature::{Keypair, Signer, read_keypair_file}
};
```

Now we're going to add in a const at the top of our file underneath our imports for the devnet API url:

```rs
const RPC_URL: &str = "https://api.devnet.solana.com";
```

Okay, we're ready to get started. Let's go to the `airdrop` function and start by reading in our keypair file:
```rs
// Import our keypair
let keypair = read_keypair_file("dev-wallet.json").expect("Couldn't find wallet file");
```

Then we'll establish a connection to Solana devnet using the const we defined above:
```rs
// Connected to Solana Devnet RPC Client
let client = RpcClient::new(RPC_URL);
```

Finally, we're going to call the airdrop function:

```rs
// We're going to claim 2 devnet SOL tokens (2 billion lamports)
match client.request_airdrop(&keypair.pubkey(), 2_000_000_000u64) {
    Ok(s) => {
        println!("Success! Check out your TX here:");
        println!("https://explorer.solana.com/tx/{}?cluster=devnet", s.to_string());
    },
    Err(e) => println!("Oops, something went wrong: {}", e.to_string())
};
```

Here is an example of the output of a successful airdrop:

```
Success! Check out your TX here:
https://explorer.solana.com/tx/459QHLHJBtkHgV3BkzGKo4CDSWzNr8HboJhiQhpx2dj8xPVqx4BtUPCDWYbbTm426mwqmdYBhEodUQZULcpvzd5z?cluster=devnet
```

## 3. Transfer tokens to your WBA Address
Now we have some devnet SOL to play with, it's time to create our first native Solana token transfer. When you first signed up for the course, you gave WBA a Solana address for certification. We're going to be sending some devnet SOL to this address so we can use it going forward.

First, we're going to add `solana-program` to our `Cargo.toml`.

```toml
solana-program = "1.15.2"
```

Then we're going to add a few more imports to let us create a transfer transaction:

```rs
use solana_client::rpc_client::RpcClient;
use solana_program::{
    pubkey::Pubkey,
    system_instruction::transfer,
};
use solana_sdk::{
    signature::{Keypair, Signer, read_keypair_file},
    transaction::Transaction
};
use std::str::FromStr;
```

Now let's open up the `transfer_sol` function, import our dev wallet as we did last time, and define our WBA public key:
```rs
// Import our keypair
let keypair = read_keypair_file("dev-wallet.json").expect("Couldn't find wallet file");

// Define our WBA public key
let to_pubkey = Pubkey::from_str("<your WBA public key>").unwrap();
```

Now let's create a connection to devnet
```rs
// Create a Solana devnet connection
let rpc_client = RpcClient::new(RPC_URL);
```

In order to sign transactions, we're going to need to get a recent blockhash, as signatures are designed to expire as a security feature:

```rs
// Get recent blockhash
let recent_blockhash = rpc_client
.get_latest_blockhash()
.expect("Failed to get recent blockhash");
```

Okay, we now have everything we need to create and sign our transaction! We're going to transfer 0.1 SOL from our dev wallet to our WBA wallet address on the Solana devnet.
```rs
let transaction = Transaction::new_signed_with_payer(
    &[transfer(
        &keypair.pubkey(),
        &to_pubkey,
        1_000_000
    )], 
    Some(&keypair.pubkey()),
    &vec![&keypair],
    recent_blockhash
);
```

Now that we've signed out transaction, we're going to submit our transaction and grab the TX signature
```rs
// Send the transaction
let signature = rpc_client
.send_and_confirm_transaction(&transaction)
.expect("Failed to send transaction");
```

If everything went as planned, we'll print a link to the TX out to the terminal
```rs
// Print our transaction out
println!(
    "Success! Check out your TX here: 
    https://explorer.solana.com/tx/{}/?cluster=devnet",
    signature
);
```

## 4. Empty devnet wallet into WBA wallet

Okay, now that we're done with our devnet wallet, let's also go ahead and send all of our remaining lamports to our WBA dev wallet. It is typically good practice to clean up accounts where we can as it allows us to reclaim resources that aren't being used which have actual monetary value on mainnet.

To send all of the remaining lamports out of our dev wallet to our WBA wallet, we're going to need to add in a few more lines of code to the above example so we can:
1. Get the exact balance of the account
2. Calculate the fee of sending the transaction
3. Calculate the exact number of lamports we can send whilst satisfying the fee rate

Start by adding `Message` to our imports.
```rs
use solana_sdk::{
    message::Message,
    signature::{Keypair, Signer, read_keypair_file},
    transaction::Transaction
};
```

To empty the account, we're going to have to find out how much balance it has. We can do that like so:

```rs
// Get balance of dev wallet
let balance = rpc_client
.get_balance(&keypair.pubkey())
.expect("Failed to get balance");
```

Now that we have the balance, we need to calculate the current fee rate for sending a transaction on devnet. To do that, we need to make a mock transaction and ask the RPC client how much it would cost to publish. We'll start by making the mock transaction as a `Message`.

```rs
// Create a test transaction to calculate fees
let message = Message::new_with_blockhash(
    &[transfer(
        &keypair.pubkey(),
        &to_pubkey,
        balance,
    )], 
    Some(&keypair.pubkey()),
    &recent_blockhash
);
```

Now we need to ask the RPC Client what the fee for this mock transaction would be:
```rs
// Calculate exact fee rate to transfer entire SOL amount out of account minus fees
let fee = rpc_client
.get_fee_for_message(&message)
.expect("Failed to get fee calculator");
```

Now that we have the balance and the fee, it's simply a matter of copying the transaction code from above and replacing the `1_000_000` lamports with the value of `balance - fee`:

```rs
// Deduct fee from lamports amount and create a TX with correct balance
let transaction = Transaction::new_signed_with_payer(
    &[transfer(
        &keypair.pubkey(),
        &to_pubkey,
        balance - fee,
    )], 
    Some(&keypair.pubkey()),
    &vec![&keypair],
    recent_blockhash
);
```

As you can see, we crated a mock version of the transaction to perform a fee calculation before removing and readding the transfer instruction, signing and sending it. You can see from the outputted transaction signature on the block explorer here that the entire value was sent to the exact lamport:
```
Check out your TX here:
https://explorer.solana.com/tx/4dy53oKUeh7QXr15wpKex6yXfz4xD2hMtJGdqgzvNnYyDNBZXtcgKZ7NBvCj7PCYU1ELfPZz3HEk6TzT4VQmNoS5?cluster=devnet
```

## 5. Submit your completion of the WBA pre-requisites program
When you first signed up for the course, you gave WBA a Solana address for certification and your Github account. Your challenge now is to use the devnet tokens you just airdropped and transferred to yourself to confirm your enrollment in the course on the Solana devnet.

In order to do this, we're going to have to quickly familiarise ourselves with two key concepts of Solana:

1. **PDA (Program Derived Address)** - A PDA is used to enable our program to "sign" transactions with a Public Key derived from some kind of deterministic seed. This is then combined with an additional "bump" which is a single additional byte that is generated to "bump" this Public Key off the elliptic curve. This means that there is no matching Private Key for this Public Key, as if there were a matching private key and someone happened to possess it, they would be able to sign on behalf of the program, creating security concerns.

2. **IDL (Interface Definition Language)** - Similar to the concept of ABI in other ecosystems, an IDL specifies a program's public interface. Though not mandatory, most programs on Solana do have an IDL, and it is the primary way we typically interact with programs on Solana. It defines a Solana program's account structures, instructions, and error codes. IDLs are .json files, so they can be used to generate client-side code, such as Typescript type definitions, for ease of use.

Let's dive into it!

#### 5.1 Consuming an IDL in Typescript
For the purposes of this class, we have published a WBA pre-requisite course program to the Solana Devnet with a public IDL that you can use to provide onchain proof that you've made it to the end of our pre-requisite coursework. 

You can find our program on Devnet by this address: [HC2oqz2p6DEWfrahenqdq2moUcga9c9biqRBcdK3XKU1](https://explorer.solana.com/address/HC2oqz2p6DEWfrahenqdq2moUcga9c9biqRBcdK3XKU1?cluster=devnet)

If we explore the devnet explorer, there is a tab called "[Anchor Program IDL](https://explorer.solana.com/address/HC2oqz2p6DEWfrahenqdq2moUcga9c9biqRBcdK3XKU1/anchor-program?cluster=devnet)" which reveals the IDL of our program. If you click the clipboard icon at the top level of this JSON object, you can copy the IDL directly from the browser. The result should look something like this:

```json
{
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "name": "wba_prereq",
  "instructions": [
    {
      "name": "complete",
      ...
    }
  ]
}
```

As you can see, this defines the schema of our program with a single instruction called `complete` that takes in 1 argument:
1. `github` - a byte representation of the utf8 string of your github account name

As well as 3 accounts:
1. `signer` - your public key you use to sign up for the WBA course
2. `prereq` - an account we create in our program with a custom PDA seed (more on this later)
3. `systemAccount` - the Solana system program which is used to execute account instructions


In order for us to consume this in rust, we're going to go and use the `solana-idlgen` macro to generate Rust code for it. Let's start off by adding these two imports to our `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
borsh = "0.10.3"
solana-idlgen = { git = "https://github.com/deanmlittle/solana-idlgen.git" }
```

Next, we must create a folder in our `src` directory called `programs` so we can easily add additional program IDLs in the future, along with two new rust files called `mod.rs` and `wba_prereq.rs`.

```sh
mkdir src/programs
touch ./src/programs/mod.rs
touch ./src/programs/wba_prereq.rs
```

Now we need to publicly declare our `wba_prereq` module in our programs module, `mod.rs`:

```rs
// Programs
pub mod wba_prereq;
```

Now we need to import and use the IDLGen macro to consume our IDL. Open up `wba_prereq.rs` and input our IDL Json into the `idlgen!` macro:

```rs
use solana_idlgen::idlgen;
idlgen!({
    "version": "0.1.0",
    "name": "wba_prereq",
    "instructions": [
        {
        "name": "complete",
        ...
        }
    ]
});
```

We will also need to populate the optional `metadata: { address }` fields of the IDL:

```rs
idlgen!({
    "version": "0.1.0",
    "name": "wba_prereq",
    ...
    "metadata": {
        "address": "HC2oqz2p6DEWfrahenqdq2moUcga9c9biqRBcdK3XKU1"
    }
});
```

You should now have a working `WbaPrereqProgram` library generated at build time! Now let's import it. We start by adding our programs module to the top of `lib.rs`, outside of our test module, so we can consume it from our crate.

```rs
mod programs;
```

Then inside our tests module, we will add the imports for the generated structs and methods we need to use:
```rs
use crate::programs::wba_prereq::{WbaPrereqProgram, CompleteArgs, UpdateArgs};
```

Now it's time to put it all together! As with last time, we need to create a Solana devnet connection:
```rs
// Create a Solana devnet connection
let rpc_client = RpcClient::new(RPC_URL);
```

Now let's define our accounts. For this exercise, we will be using our WBA wallet. Unlike the `dev-wallet.json` we generated, we care about maintaining the security of this private key. To stop you from accidentally comitting your private key(s) to a git repo, consider adding a `.gitignore` file. Here's an example that will ignore all files that end in `wallet.json`:

```.gitignore
*wallet.json
```

Okay, now we can add our WBA wallet:
```rs
// Let's define our accounts
let signer = read_keypair_file("wba-wallet.json").expect("Couldn't find wallet file");
```

Next up, we'll be creating our first PDA.

#### 5.2 Creating a PDA
Now we need to create a PDA for our `prereq` account. The seeds for this particular PDA are:

1. A `u8` array of the text: "prereq"
2. A `u8` array of the `Pubkey` of the transaction signer

These are then combined into an array of `u8` array pointers and combined with the `program` ID to create a deterministic address for this account. The `derive_program_address` function is going to combine this with the `program` id and calculate a `bump` for it to find an address that is not on the elliptic curve and then return the derived address:

Remember to familiarize yourself with this concept as you'll be using it often!

```rs
let prereq = WbaPrereqProgram::derive_program_address(&[b"prereq", signer.pubkey().to_bytes().as_ref()]);
```

#### 5.3 Putting it all together
Now that we have everything we need, it's finally time to put it all together and make a transaction interacting with the devnet program to submit our `github` account and our `Pubkey` to signify our completion of the WBA pre-requisite materials!

We have to populate our instruction data. In this case, we are setting your Github account username:
```rs
// Define our instruction data
let args = CompleteArgs {
    github: b"testaccount".to_vec()
};
```

To publish our transaction, as we last time, we need a recent block hash:

```rs
// Get recent blockhash
let blockhash = rpc_client
.get_latest_blockhash()
.expect("Failed to get recent blockhash");
```

Now we need to populate our `complete` function:
```rs
// Now we can invoke the "complete" function
let transaction = WbaPrereqProgram::complete(
    &[&signer.pubkey(), &prereq, &system_program::id()],
    &args,
    Some(&signer.pubkey()),           
    &[&signer],
    blockhash
);
```

Finally, we publish our transaction!
```rs
// Send the transaction
let signature = rpc_client
.send_and_confirm_transaction(&transaction)
.expect("Failed to send transaction");

// Print our transaction out
println!("Success! Check out your TX here: https://explorer.solana.com/tx/{}/?cluster=devnet", signature);
```

Congratulations, you have completed the WBA Solana Q2 Pre-requisite coursework!
